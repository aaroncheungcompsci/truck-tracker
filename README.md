# Truck Tracker
This application is designed to assist in managing the assembly of trucks in Coolidge, AZ.

## About this project
Users will be able to drag and drop VIN numbers of trucks to their respective buckets, indicating <br>
that they are at the indicated station. The buckets are named after each particular station in offline.

Data is tracked by communicating with SQL Server to access current data as well as transmitting new data for <br>
record-keeping. The goal of this project is to be able to keep track of detailing which stations any <br>
particular truck has been to as well as the history of the trucks in offline,the time spent at each station. 

## Using/Setting up this project
You will need to install a couple of things: Git, and an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). <br>

- <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>

As for an IDE, the main and preferred choice is VS (Visual Studio) Code, but you may use any other IDE that <br>
you are comfortable developing in.

- <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>

Once you have an IDE installed, you want to install Node.js as it will be needed to run the below scripts. <br>
I have provided a link to Node.js <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">here</a>.

This is just for setting up the front end side of things.

# Status as of finishing the internship
This application is far from perfect. However, with the provided documentation, I believe this to be at the very least
a solid foundation towards what is to come in the future. This version of the project will not be updated or improved
upon, as the purpose of showcasing this application is to serve as a step within my journey of developing my career.

I have learned so much throughout the development process of this application during my time at Nikola Corporation,
ranging from moderate components like React JS to the ever expanding scale of full stack web app development. While
I do not consider myself extremely well versed in the software development life cycle, I have at the very least
managed to loosely follow the Agile SCRUM methodology to develop an application that has a solid foundation that
can be built upon by future developers.
