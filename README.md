# Truck Tracker
This application is designed to assist in managing the assembly of trucks in Coolidge, AZ.

## About this project
Users will be able to drag and drop VIN numbers of trucks to their respective buckets, indicating <br>
that they are at the indicated station. The buckets are named after each particular station in offline.

Data is tracked by communicating with SQL Server to access current data as well as transmitting new data for <br>
record-keeping. The goal of this project is to be able to keep track of detailing which stations any <br>
particular truck has been to as well as the history of the trucks in offline,the time spent at each station. 

## Using/Setting up this project
You will need to install a couple of things: Git, and an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). <br>

- <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>

As for an IDE, the main and preferred choice is VS (Visual Studio) Code, but you may use any other IDE that <br>
you are comfortable developing in.

- <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>

Once you have an IDE installed, you want to install Node.js as it will be needed to run the below scripts. <br>
I have provided a link to Node.js <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">here</a>.

For more information and documentation, please check out the directory named `manual`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject` (DO NOT EVER RUN THIS UNTIL PERMITTED TO DO SO)

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
