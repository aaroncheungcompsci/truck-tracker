# User Manual
This is where the user manual is located. In this directory, you can find 
three files: 

- Documentation for the application
- `thingstodo.txt`
- `dbdesign.txt`

These files are fairly straightforward. `dbdesign.txt` and `thingstodo.txt` are
both mentioned accordingly from within the documentation for the application. Reading 
the entirety of the documentation is recommended to understand where these two text 
files come into play. Also, be sure that this manual is the most up to date version.
