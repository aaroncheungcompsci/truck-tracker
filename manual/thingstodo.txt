Things to do (order is from most -> least important)
============================
 - Implement the display of the oldest truck that is currently in offline
	- need to figure out how to get the difference between current date and move in date
	  to determine oldest truck and have live updates
 - Implement the ability to add comments and set specific location for a station 
 - Getting data for trucks from MES database and linking it to database
	for application
	- data is on a completely different server than the one I have
	developed database on, don't know when this will be resolved. 
	Dependent on Luis and Francois (unknown timeframe)
 - Setting up application on webserver at Coolidge plant
	- will require 2-3 hours of setup
	- may need to adjust some backend logic 
	- speak to Dan Grebenisan for assistance on this topic
 - Optimize code in the backend for ease of debugging (not as important, but good to get to when possible)
 - Implement unit tests for ease of testing new features in the future
   (refer to this video as a guideline: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYDEEdiLWKI)


Features in "Backlog" (not important for getting application up and running)
============================
 - Ability to create bucket without having to manually mess with frontend logic
 - Searching VIN number in offline buckets should return where the VIN is placed
 - Accounting for VIN numbers over 1000
 - Ability to extract data from database as a spreadsheet file
